I have a 4-year-old daughter who is curious about computers and loves mermaids. It was only a matter of time before the connection was made!

Starting with the very basics:

## 1. Draw something, and see how we get it onto the computer

- photograph it,
- cut out the shape in a photo editor.

## 2. Animate it

- put the drawing on a web page,
- make it move,
- play with different animation settings.

## 3. Teach the mermaid some tricks.

- add some buttons that apply a certain animation when clicked
- experiment with different kinds of animations
